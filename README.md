# ComputerVisionProjects
This repository contains a collection of computer vision projects that demonstrate the application of various computer vision techniques using OpenCV and MediaPipe. These projects utilize real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition to interact with the system in innovative ways.
### Requirements:
    Python 3.x
    OpenCV
    MediaPipe
    PyCaw
    A webcam
    NumPy
## **Project 1: Volume Control With Hand**
This project uses computer vision to track hand movements, count the number of fingers shown to the camera, and control the system volume using hand gestures. The code leverages OpenCV for image processing, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and the PyCaw library for audio control.
### Features:
    Real-time hand detection and tracking
    Finger counting
    Overlay images based on the number of fingers detected
    Volume control using hand gestures
    Display of frames per second (FPS)
## **Project 2: Finger Count**
This project uses computer vision to track hand movements and count the number of fingers shown to the camera. The code leverages OpenCV for image processing and a custom hand tracking module (HandTrackingModule.py) for detecting hand landmarks.
### Features:
    Real-time hand detection and tracking
    Finger counting
    Overlay images based on the number of fingers detected
    Display of frames per second (FPS)
## **Project 3: Virtual Painter**
This project is a Virtual Painter application that uses computer vision techniques to create a real-time drawing interface. By using a webcam, the application tracks hand movements and allows the user to draw on the screen with different colors and an eraser tool. This project leverages the capabilities of OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand tracking and drawing functionalities.
### Features:
    Hand Tracking: Utilizes MediaPipe to detect and track hand movements.
    Drawing Modes: Allows drawing with different colors (pink, green, blue) and an eraser.
    Selection Mode: Switch between colors and the eraser using specific hand gestures.
    Real-Time Processing: Processes video frames in real-time to provide a smooth drawing experience.
